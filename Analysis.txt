- Task 0 Worst-Case Big-O Notation is O(1)

- Task 1 Worst-Case Big-O Notation is O(n + m): n is the number of call records and m is the number of text records

- Task 2 Worst-Case Big-O Notation is O(n + m): n is the number of call records and m is the number of unique phone numbers in the phones_and_times dictionary

- Task 3: 
+ Part A Worst-Case Big-O Notation is O(n + m + o log o + o): create a list is O(n) - n is the number of records from the origin calls, create a set is O(m) - m is the number of records from the created list, sort is O(o log o) - o is the number of records from the created set and iterates through the sort set will be O(o) (so n > m > o)

+ Part B Worst-Case Big-O Notation is O(n + m): n is the number of call records used to create list_numbers and m is the number of records in the created list_numbers (so n > m)

- Task 4 Worst-Case Big-O Notation is O(2n + m + o log o + o): n is the number of call records, m is the number of text records, sort is O(o log o) - o is the number of records from the set and iterates through the sort set will be O(o) so (n > o and m > o)
